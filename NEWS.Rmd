# SSP 1.1.0

## Function adjustments

- `simdata()` now includes the new `jitter.base` parameter, which allows controlled stochastic perturbations of site-level parameters. This feature increases variability among simulated communities, particularly in nested designs (e.g., sites within regions), where previous versions tended to generate unrealistically similar communities. By applying mild randomness to occurrence and abundance probabilities, `simdata()` produces simulated data sets with multivariate dispersion closer to empirical expectations. 

- The use of `jitter.base` is optional (default `jitter.base = 0`), so existing workflows remain unchanged. Users who wish to reproduce the behavior of earlier versions can simply ignore this parameter. For reproducibility, remember to use `set.seed()` before calling `simdata()`.

# SSP 1.0.2 (2025-04-23)

## Changes requested by CRAN

- Updated cross-references in `.Rd` files to use explicit package anchors (e.g., `\link[ggplot2:ggplot2-package]{ggplot2}`) as requested by the CRAN team.
- Removed all `\link{}` usages without package anchors in documentation files.
- Ensured compatibility with HTML reference manuals.

## Documentation improvements

- All .Rd documentation files were migrated to the **roxygen2** format.
- Improved consistency and accuracy in the documentation of function arguments and outputs.
- Added missing imports in the NAMESPACE to fix visibility issues (`ggplot`, `geom_point`, `specnumber`, etc.).
- Removed unused `@importFrom` tags and documented only necessary dependencies.

## Code adjustments

- Replaced use of `rel()` in `plot_ssp()` to avoid dependency on `grid::rel`, which is not exported.
- Reformatted long lines in examples to comply with CRAN's 100-character limit.

## Testing and validation

- `devtools::check()` returns **0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 notes** (only minor ones related to timestamp verification).
