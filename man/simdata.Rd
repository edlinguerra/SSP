\usage{
simdata(Par, cases, N, sites, jitter.base = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{Par}{A list of parameters estimated by \code{\link{assempar}}.}

\item{cases}{Number of data sets to simulate.}

\item{N}{Number of samples to simulate in each site.}

\item{sites}{Number of sites to simulate in each data set.}

\item{jitter.base}{Numeric scalar in \eqn{[0,1)}. Standard deviation multiplier used to add Gaussian jitter to \code{fs} and \code{fw}. Defaults to 0.}
}
\value{
A list of simulated community data sets, to be used by \code{\link{datquality}} and \code{\link{sampsd}}.
}
\description{
Simulates multiple ecological data sets using parameters estimated from a pilot study. The output can be used in
downstream SSP functions for quality evaluation and sampling effort estimation.
}
\details{
Presence/absence data are simulated using Bernoulli trials based on empirical frequencies of occurrence among sites (for site-level presence)
and within sites (for local occurrence patterns). To better reflect realistic variability among nested sampling units (e.g., sites within regions),
the simulation can apply controlled perturbations to the base parameters. This jittering introduces stochastic variation in occurrence probabilities
across sites, while preserving the overall probabilistic structure of each species. As a result, simulated communities exhibit levels of multivariate
dispersion closer to those observed in empirical data. These matrices are then converted into abundance matrices using values drawn from
Poisson or negative binomial distributions (for count data), or from log-normal distributions (for continuous data like coverage or biomass),
depending on the aggregation properties estimated in the pilot data.

This process is repeated \code{cases} times, producing a list of simulated data sets that reflect the statistical properties of the original
assemblage, but without incorporating environmental constraints or species co-occurrence structures.
}
\note{
This simulation assumes that differences in composition or abundance are due to spatial aggregation, as captured by the pilot data.
It does not incorporate environmental gradients or species associations. For more advanced modeling of species associations,
copula-based approaches as suggested by Anderson et al. (2019) may be integrated in future versions of SSP.

When using \code{jitter.base}, the simulation introduces stochastic perturbations to site-level parameters. For reproducibility, use
\code{set.seed()} before calling \code{simdata()}.

\examples{
## Single site simulation
data(micromollusk)
par.mic <- assempar(data = micromollusk, type = "P/A", Sest.method = "average")
sim.mic <- simdata(par.mic, cases = 2, N = 10, sites = 1)

## Multiple site simulation
data(sponges)
par.spo <- assempar(data = sponges, type = "counts", Sest.method = "average")
set.seed(42)
sim.spo <- simdata(par.spo, cases = 2, N = 20, sites = 10, jitter.base = 0.5)
