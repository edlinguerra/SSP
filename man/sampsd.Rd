\title{Sampling Simulated Data and Estimates Multivariate Standard Errors

}
\description{
Each set of simulated data is sampled many times for each sampling effort, from 2 replicates to those defined as an argument in the function. Then, distance-based multivariate standard errors is estimated using pseudo-variance (for single site evaluation) or Mean Squares estimates in a linear model (for multisite evaluation).
}
\usage{
sampsd(dat.sim, Par, transformation, method, n, m, k)
}

\arguments{
  \item{dat.sim}{
A list of data sets generated by \code{\link{simdata}}
}
  \item{Par}{
A list of parameters estimated by \code{\link{assempar}}
}
  \item{transformation}{
Mathematical function to reduce the weight of very dominant species: 'square root', 'fourth root', 'Log (X+1)', 'P/A', 'none'
}
  \item{method}{
The appropiate distance/dissimilarity metric (e.g. Gower, Brayâ€“Curtis, Jaccard, etc). The function \code{\link[vegan]{vegdist}} is call for that purpose.
  }
  \item{n}{
Maximum number of samples to take at each site. Can be equal or less than N
  }
  \item{m}{
Maximum number of sites to sample at each data set. Can be equal or less than sites
  }
  \item{k}{
Number of repetitions of each sampling effort (samples and sites) at each data set
  }
}
\details{
If several sites had been generated, subsets of sites of size 2 to m are sampled, followed by the selection of sampling units (from 2 to n) using inclusion probabilities and self-weighted two-stage sampling (Tille, 2011). Each combination of sampling effort (number of sample units and sites), are repeated several times (e.g. k = 100) for all simulated matrixes. If simulated data correspond to a single site, sampling without replacement is performed several times (e.g. k = 100) for each sample size (from 2 to n) within each simulated matrix. This approach is computationally intensive, especially when k is high. Keep this in mind because it will affect the time to get results. For each sample, suitable pre-treatments are applied and distance/similarity matrixes estimated using the appropriate coefficient. When simulations were done for a single site, the *MultSE* is estimated as the square root of the quotient between the pseudo variance and the sampling effort (Anderson & Santana-Garcon, 2015). When several sites were generated, MultSE are estimated using the residual mean squares and the sites mean squares from a PERMANOVA model (Anderson & Santana-Garcon, 2015).

\value{
\item{mse.results}{
A matrix including all estimated MultSE for each simulated data, combination of sample replicates and sites for each k repetition. This matrix will be used by \code{\link{summary_ssp}}}

\note{
For quick exploratory analyzes, keep the number of repetitions small. Once you have explored the behavior of the MultSE, you can repeat the process keeping k-value large (e.g. 100). This process will take some time, it will depend on the power of your computer.
