Description: Simulation-based sampling protocol (SSP) uses dissimilarity-based multivariate standard error (MultSE)
    as an estimator of precision to evaluate the adequacy of different sampling efforts (i.e. number of sample replicates) 
    at different spatial scales. The procedure consists in simulating several extensive data matrixes that mimic some of 
    the relevant ecological features of the community of interest using a pilot data set. For each simulated data, several 
    sampling efforts are repeatedly executed and MultSE calculated. The mean value, 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of MultSE 
    for each sampling effort across all simulated data are then plotted, and an adequate sampling effort is identified as that
    where the slope of the relation stabilizes. SSP is provided in five functions: AssemPar for extrapolation of assemblage
    parameters using pilot data; SimData for simulation of several data sets based on extrapolated parameters; DatQuality 
    for evaluation of plausibility of simulated data; SampSD for repeated estimations of MultSE for different sampling designs 
    in simulated data sets; and MSEplot for visualization of the behaviour of MultSE for each sampling design across all simulated 
    data sets.
