Description: The Simulation-based Sampling Protocol (SSP) is an R package designed to estimate sampling effort in studies of ecological communities. It is based on the concept of pseudo-multivariate standard error (MultSE) (Anderson & Santana-Garcon, 2015, <doi:10.1111/ele.12385>) and the simulation of ecological data. The theoretical background is described in Guerra-Castro et al. (2020, <doi:10.1111/ecog.05284>).
